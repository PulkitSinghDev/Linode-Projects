1. Shredded Humans


[Lyrics by Jack and Chris]

Early hours, open road, family of five - on their way home
Having enjoyed a day in the sun, their encounter with gore has just begun
A homicidal fool not knowing left from right, now has the family in his sight
Trying to perceive if he's blind or insane,
he steers his car into the other lane

Both of them collide, expressions horrified
Head on at full speed, the vultures will soon feed

The father of three was impaled on the wheel,
as his skull became a part of the dash
His eyeballs ejected his sight uneffected, he saw his own organs collapse
His seatbelt was useless for holding him back, it simply cut him in two
Legs were crushed, out leaked pus as his spinal cord took off and flew
The mother took flight through the glass, and ended up impaled on a sign
Her intestines stretched from the car down the road for a quarter of a mile

Fourth child on the way, won't live another day
Fetus on the road, with mangled little bones
Little children fly, not a chance to wonder why
Smashed against the ceiling, all their skin burning and peeling
Shards of glass explode, chest and skull now implode
Corpses they've become, and graves will have to be dug

Underneath the wheels, burning rubber on your face
Bleeding from your eyes, the slaughtered victims lies
Knowing what he's done, he just backs up one more time
Laughing at the mess, a pile of meat on the street

One child left slowly dying now, arteries gushing blood
Now it's time to feed on flesh, the gore has just begun

Early hours, open road, family of five - on their way home
Having enjoyed a day in the sun, their encounter with gore has just begun
A homicidal fool not knowing left from right, now has the family in his sight
Trying to perceive if he's blind or insane,
he steers his car into the other lane

The look of death in my eye
Surely no-one will survive
Just a pile of mush
Left to dry in the sun

I see my fresh kill
Left in the road
Remains of your bodies
Mangled and torn

[Solo: Bob]
[Solo: Jack]

One child left slowly dying now, arteries gushing blood
Now it's time to feed on flesh, the gore has just begun


2. Edible Autopsy


[Lyrics by Chris]

Wheeled in on a cart, lying dormant not dead
Hospital of immortality, butcher their patients bloody red
Taken to a dark room, fear of impending doom
The doctor straps you down, with an evil grin
Grabs his rusty blade, ripping through flesh and vein
He tortures his patients through evil means

You can't try to fight them, first they change your brain
beyond the realm of evil, their means are insane
Mutilated beyond belief, but still kept alive
Pathologist of death gouging out your eyes

Guts and blood, bones are broken
As they eat your pancreas
Human liver, for their diner
Or maybe soup with eyes
Cause of death, still unknown
Gnawing meat, from your bones
Bone saw binding in your skull
Brains are oozing a human stump
Needles injected, through your eyes
Puiling off flesh, skinned alive

Killing for free in blood they will trust, and they must never forsake
feeding on blood that brought them abound, and they must kill tonight
Genocide, suicide, screaming cries, in hell you will die

Lying dormant not dead
Hospital of immortality, butcher their patients bloody red
Taken to a dark room, fear of impending doom
The doctor straps you down, with an evil grin
Grabs his rusty blade, ripping through flesh and vein
He tortures his patients through evil means


3. Put Them To Death


[Lyrics by Chris]

Evil people with evil minds
Slaughter their victims with ripping knives
They should be caught and put to death
Strapped to the chair, they should die there

Blood spewing from their eyes
As you hear their sinful cries
Destroy their evil minds
We should take their fucking lives
They should be caught and punished
For what they have done
Torture them slowly it would be fun
Kill them all off one by one

Let them go - no torture them slow
Fuck you - and your kind
We don't need you, or your lives
Execute by injection
Execution by electricution

Evil people with evil minds
Slaughter their victims with ripping knives
They should be caught and put to death
Strapped to the chair, they should die there


4. Mangled


[Lyrics by Chris and Paul]

Demolition of bodies, smashed and broken, piles of guts, moist and steaming
Tendons severing, brains are boiling, unburied corpses in state of decay
Rotten limbs start to ferment, torso's torn in two
Skin ripped off to expose muscle tissue, butchered for human stew
Crawl into the cadaver head first, eat your way through the guts
The purgent smell of decaying innards is enough to drive you nuts
The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your mouth
As you chew on the piss filled kidney's
Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving nothing but bones
Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of death fill the air
Bones sticking out, ripped from sockets, blood spurting everywhere
Victim lying dead, neck but no head, smearing remains on your own face
Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of death fill the air

Blistering flesh, another death, stiffened bones, morbid groans
Evil mind, brain oozing slime, feel the pain
Body weak brain contorting, fluid flowing from your organs
Veins torn our, Mangled
Festering flesh, quivering cadaver, ligaments stretched around your own neck
Drink the pus, Mangled
Severed dick, bloody bowels, the gutted corpse now lies hollow
Feeding on feces, Mangled
Amputated arms, crushing legs, head is ripped right off your shoulders
Thrown in a pile, Mangled
Limbs rearranged, head on backwards a humongous heap of twisting flesh
Sewn together, Mangled - Mangled

His knife plunges in your cold battered body
Blood seeping through, the jagged wounds he cuts
Unbearable pain, give into death
Your life slips away, perish in blood

Menacing madman mutilating
Destroying, disfiguring, dead you'll be
Crushing, cracking, killing you
Annihilation, desecration

Born through modern day science
Man has made his last mistake
A creature so hideously horrible
Leaving nothing to waste
Evil has a new face, a mangled horrible face
His views are those of death, nothing will stop his lust

Slicing victims left to decay, listening to their mortal cries
Unhuman, immortal, bestial, now he owns your soul
Crawl into the cadaver head first, eat your way through the guts
The pungent smell of decaying innards is enough to drive you nuts
The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your mouth
As you chew on the piss filled kidney's
Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving nothing but bones

Human converted to beast, the perfect killing machine
Psychotic structure of brain tissue, murder his only memory
Dependant on death, crushing your head, I'm addicted to blood
Chew the decay

[Solo - Bob]

The weakened man must die, tearing out his insides
Smashing all the bones, hear his tormenting groans

[Solo - Jack]


5. Scattered Remains, Splattered Brains


[Lyrics by Jack and Chris]

Prepare to witness a place of gore
Of legal dissection and blood on the floor
Carved up corpses, in the corner
Sliced up by a psychotic coroner
Slice, dice, chop them haphazardly
Like laboratory mice, splatter brain matter
Pound on the skull until it shatters

Hack, slice, chop, carve, rip and tear
Carving up your eyeballs, watch them sit and stare
Tear, rip, slice, carve, chop, hack
Toss them into a sack

Tags on bare feet, means a real treat, to the butcher of human meat
Slice the throat from ear to ear, gallons of blood do appear
Veins exposed, torn from bodies, the most interesting of hobbies
To get paid for such a task is more than any man could ask

Prepare to witness a place of gore
Of legal disection and blood on the floor
Carved up corpses, in the corner
Sliced up by a psychotic coroner
Slice, dice, chop them haphazardly
Like laboratory mice, splatter brain matter
Pound on the skull until it shatters

Hack, slice, chop, carve, rip and tear
Carving up your eyeballs, watch them sit and stare
Tear, rip, slice, carve, chop, hack
Toss them into a sack

Ripping, tearing your skin turning red
Vile surgeon, knife cutting in
Skull cracking, to expose your brain
Evil doctor death drove him insane


6. Born In A Casket


[lyrics by Chris]

Enter the crypts of hell, to impregnate the dead
Fresh burial sight, my hunger grows tonight
Undying lust for cadaverous molestation
Sights of death building my sensations
Ferocious need for decomposing bodies

Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot
Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch

Raging fires of hell, burning through my soul
My love for a dead fuck, I cannot control
The child soon will rise, all evil will survive
Birth through death

The newborn needs a feast, its mother is the meal
Chomping on her flesh, his teeth tearing her skin
I love to fuck the dead, demons in my head
Tearing at my brain

Bleeding sores beginning to stench
While you lick the festering stump
Green infection discharging pus
Devour the putrid afterbirth

Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot
Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch


7. Rotting Head


[Lyrics by Jack and Chris]

A quivering pile of useless flesh, locked in a padded cell
Hidden from the prying eyes of curiosity
Experimental surgery made him what he is today
His head is rotting but his body lives on as a worthless vegetable
Unknown to mankind, the incredible power of his mind

Hideous heredity, genetic imbalance, resorting to cannibalism
A feast begins as the patient's skull is cracked open like a walnut
Brains devoured in a frenzied slaughter, thrist for gore nothing more
Bile is dripping, pus from wounds, as the coroner drinks it down

The sights before your eyes you can't describe
A trip through this living hell will rot away your skull

Genital lacerating, anal asyphyxiation
Blockade of bowel passage, defåcation, hemmorage
Cadaverous mutilation, metamorphial radiation
Devourance of arteries, decapitated extremeties
Cranial excavation, cerebral liquidation
Brain turned to soup, ears are dripping goop

Slimy, cozing, dripping pus, torn out fingernails starting to fuse
Shredded cartilage victim lies, eye sockets, but no eyes
Miles of intestines strewn all about, facial features strickened with gout
Hanging bodies dripping with blood, the blackened fluid sinks in the mud

[Solo: Bob]
[Solo: Jack]

A quivering pile of useless flesh, locked in a padded cell


8. The Undead Will Feast


[Lyrics by Jack, Alex and Chris]

Undead feast, as they tear upon your weak flesh
Terror builds, at the thought of being dead
Prophecy of the wisemen of old
Now comes true, as the corpses break the soil
Ancient spell breaks the sleep of the dead
The dead awake, what the populace is fearing
Panic strikes as the nations run in fear
Oceans boil with blood of human victims

Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead
Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh
Psychotic, transmutated corpses, upsuring the population
Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us

Tables turn as a victim I've become now
State of death only waiting to return
Vital signs that show I'm dead
This can't happen, I'm rising from my own grave
Hunger grows not nutritional but instinctual
Flesh becomes my only crave of this live
Unthinking state, a state of metamorphisis
Seeking food to keep me dead
Degenerate, a product of man's frustration for his terror
Insatiable hunger for mankind, building with each kill
Seeking human victims to meet my fill
Cannibal I've become, what's happened to my brain

Feast on the corpse, suck out his brain
As its fluids drip down the drain
Chew on the bones, drink from its bladder
The vile stench only makes me madder

In through the mouth, out the forehead
Brains fall out, skin turns red
Violent surge, a spear through the skull
Felt the urge, now my heart's full

I crave gore, I'll eat your guts

I love gore, blood drives me nuts
I drink blood, I don't like water
Intestines my cud, I feast in the slaughter
Twist its neck, make it crack

Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead
Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh
Psychotic, transmutated corpses, upsuring the population
Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us
Blood I want to drink, I want to suck
Brains I want to eat, the rest I'll chuck
Bones into a spear, I'll carve and kill
Hunger for the quest, I'll never fill

[Solo - Bob]

I crave gore, I'll eat your guts

[Solo - Jack]


9. Bloody Chunks


[Lyrics by Chris]

Walking down the street, the smell of death in the air
What a rotting stench
My imagination runs wild at what this could be
Open up the can to discover a dead body

Or what was left of one, pieces in a bag
Blood is everywhere what a retched sight
Cut up really small by a razor sharp knife
Lying in the garbage no one else knows
What I have found, what should I do
Take it to the police or make it into stew
This was an evil commited by the insane
Looking down laughing, I am the same

The sight of death drives me nuts, I must kill, to control my brain
Swept away by my lust to cause pain, mutilation is my only want
The evil inside me gives me the strength to kill at will
My life is the means to cause death in the most sinister ways

I see it in your eyes the fear that keeps me alive
I'll take it away, your life will end today
I'll leave you to rot, what a sick odor
Scream all you want, but you can't stop this horror

Tasting your life as I drink your blood
Ripping out your insides, chewing on your spleen
Dead or living flesh is what I crave
I'll kill someone or eat from a grave


10. A Skull Full Of Maggots


[Lyrics by Chris]

Lying there cold after a torturous death
Your life ended fast you took your last breath
Dead in a grave, your final place
The maggots infest your disfigured face
Pus through your veins takes the place of blood
Decay sets in, bones begin to crack
Thrown six feet down left to rot
Brains oozing black down the side of your broken neck

Skull full of maggots

They enter your tomb - maggots - beginning to feast - maggots
Crawling on you - maggots - now they eat you - maggots
Rotting maggots - maggots - infesting your corpse - maggots
Parasites of the dead - maggots - now dwell in your head

Lying there cold after a torturous death
Your life ended fast you took your last breath
Dead in a grave, your final place
The maggots infest your disfigured face
Pus through your veins takes the place of blood
Decay sets in, bones begin to crack
Thrown six feet down left to rot
Brains oozing black down the side of your broken neck


11. Buried In The Backyard


[Lyrics by Chris]

To kill, is why I live
My God, gives eternal life
Slice you, i watch your blood flow
Rotten brains, I feed 'till I'm full
Pressure building, the body starts to swell

The souls of my victims brings me great power
Feasting on flesh by the hour
Lungs explode as I cave in your chest
Probing through your organs - searching for meat
Chewing the heart of my kill builds by evil will
Bodies emptied of blood to fill my sacrificial chalice
I stalk my prey at night, I need to kill tonight
To strengthen my evil soul, those that I kill worship me below
I am your worst reality, pain and torture of humanity
Violent ways of insanity, there is no end to this cruelty

In my grasp, I'll kill you fast, I'll send your soul to hell
Butchery of Human beings is the only life I know
My armies of zombies will inherit the earth, and answer to my spells
Mutilated the human race in search for immortals

I drag the carcass home, it feels stiff and cold
Incantation of the devil to rob it of its soul
Consume the lifeless cadaver, I drink your blackened blood
Its death flows through my body, indulge in its pain

Crucifixion in the cemetery, awakes the dead from their sleep
Rising from their graves, to devour the weakened mortals
Under my control, I own their tortured souls

1. Hammer Smashed Face


There's something inside me
It's, it's coming out
I feel like killing you
Let loose of the anger, held back too long
My blood runs cold

Through my anatomy, dwells another being
Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding
Brutality now becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge's my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead

Eyes bulging from their sockets
With every swing of my mallet
I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in
through the cracks, blood does leak
distorted beauty, catastrophe
Steaming slop, splattered all over me

Lifeless body, slouching dead
Lecherous abcess, where you once had a head

Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust
You will never live again, soon your life will end
I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face
facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half

Crushing, cranial, contents

Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon
Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions

Suffer, and then you die
Torture, pulverized

At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, no one can stop me

Created to kill, the carnage continues
Violently reshaping human facial tissue

Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge's my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead


2. I Cum Blood


Swollen with liquid
Ready to burst
A load of my lymph
Will quench this dead body's thirst
One month in the grave
twisted and half decayed
She turned a putrid yellow
I pissed in her maggot filled asshole

Fucking the rotting
My semen is bleeding
The smell of decay
Seeps from her genital cavity

The smell was unbearable
As I unburied her
I cum blood from my erection
I feel it run
down her throat, swallow
Eyes glassy and vacant
body dug up to play with
Skin greasy and naked
tounguing her rotted anus

I need a live woman
to fill with my fluid
A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill
her body exceptional
she thought I was normal
but I wanted more

I came blood inside of her
chocking on the clot
gagging on the snot
gushing blood, from her mouth
bloody gel leaking out
Body buried in a shallow grave
Unmarked for none to find
The sickness I have left behind
Undetected go my crimes
The greatest thrill of my life
To slit my own cock with a knife

Violent, climax
Serging serum
on my skin

Back from the dead
I am resurrected
to spew, putrefaction


3. Addicted To Vaginal Skin


[Speech intro:]
I don't know
I just took that knife
And I cut her from her neck
Down to anus
And I cut out the vagina
And I ate it

A relapse of my body
Sends my mind into multiple seizures
Psychologically a new human being
One that has never been

Cursed by the shamen
his voodoo spell has my soul
My limbs
go numb
I can't control my own thought
Are his now
his evil consuming me
ever telling me
begin the clit carving

Slowly turning me, into a flesh eating zombie
Knowing this spell can only be broken
by the vaginal skins of young women
I proceed to find the meat
their bleeding cunts will set me free
I can't control my own thought
I can't control my own thoughts
Warmth seeping from this
Body
Rotted
After I sucked the blood from her ass

I feel more alive
more alive than I've ever been
Even though now I'm dead within

My mouth drools
As I slice your perinium
My body smeared
With the guts I've extracted
through her hole, came swollen organs
cunnilingus with the mutilated

My spirit returned from the dead
Released by the priest
but I felt more real
when I was dead

The curse is broken
I have a dependence on vaginal skin
It's become my sexual addiction
I must slit, the twitching clit
Rotted cavity hold the juice

Between the legs, I love to carve
My cock is dripping with her blood


4. Split Wide Open


Melting thoughts of disintegration
Hitting deep her insistance
to mutilate her newborn infants
After giving birth her mind wasn't the same
Slowly slipping away, a state of mental decay
Family now complete
Father watches on
As mother dismembers
her newborn son

Dissecting the specimen, split
I will explore, the body wide open
Uncover carnage within, split wide open
Virgin, untouched skin
Releasing her rage
That dwells inside
tainted blood rushes through veins
her body chemically changed
Love was erased, on the edge of a butcher's knife

The kitchen becomes a makeshift slaughterhouse
every nine months she butchers one more child
Reminders of the deceased, scattered through the home

Bones and skulls of sons and daughters
Genitals ferment
In jars inside the cupboards
for father to dissect
No one will discover the murder they commit

Children used like laboratory rats
Sickening vulgar experiments
She sees what others can't
Probing the guts of her fetus
Advocation of the pain
Mutilating, draining veins

Witness the horror
offering to themselves
Continuing murdering their own kind
Never deny this fantasy life, they enjoy
Addiction to this heightened state
Post-birth psychosis
disjointing her own children
form the life they'll never live
A massacre within her soul
Struggling for control


5. Necropedophile


I was once a man before I transformed
into this molester, freshly deceased children
You have born, torn by my rape
The dead are not safe, the lifeless child corpse
I will violate

Pleasure from the dead, complete satisfaction
I open the coffin
Sick thoughts run through my head as I stare
At the dead, over and over, I can't escape
I begin the dead sex, licking her young, rotted orifice
I cum in her cold cunt, shivering with ecstasy
for nine days straight I do the same
She becomes by dead, decayed child sex slave
her neck I hack, cutting through the back
I use her mouth to eject

Here I cum, blood gushes from
bleeding black blood
her head disconnected
As I came, viciously I cut, through her jugular vein
She's already dead, I masturbate with her severed head
My lubrication, her decomposition
Spending my life molesting dead children

Intercourse with infants
Curing heads on top of spikes
boiling skulls
Skin sliding off of bones

Voices
The voices call
Voices
The voices are calling me
Buried dead I've spiritually infected
Call to me from beyond their graves

Bleed
I now bleed pus
I bleed, the blood of the dead
I bleed on her livid skin
Thrusting myself within
Beginning to chop through her hairless crotch
Beyond what we know as death
It haunts me everyday
I hear the voice of every child
That lies next to me decayed
A fresh corpse, to fill with my infection
Tortured before death, no orifice left unfilled

Violated after death
Virgin hole I infest
Anal pore spewing cess
The sacred juice I injest
Your dead child I defile
Necropedophile


6. The Cryptic Stench


Tearing at my neck my sharpened teeth pierce the meat
My warm bloodied prey sustains my life for one more day
The oldest of souls, left behind after life
Before death I was nothing but human

Indulgence in the blood, intoxicated from its drug
It warms my cold soul

Tapping the gushing sap, trickling down my throat
Rejuvenation of my body
No blood left to scab
Now it flows through my veins
Heaven I have found
Fear in my grip
Transcend beyond mortal
The sweet blood
I will swallow
Draining the inner spirit
Feasting on the power
Knowing only pleasure
Human blood I devour

Ghastly beauty look into my eyes
to reproduce with the living
every century

Impregnation of the virgin
I drink the blood of the unborn
Returning to my grave
dragging my blood drained prey
My body burns from the light
Sleeping until night

In my clutch, you greet me with open arms
soon I will rip them off
And drink the blood from the stumps
Life and death are too clear
but mankind is blind to see
the twisted path of their own mortality

Scripts of the dead
Netherworld knowledge
Rotten fragrance lingers
Unleash the odor
I have risen

Vampire
Zombie
Sucking on
Arteries
body
numbs
One of my sons died for your sins
Resurrect him so I can
drink his blood again


7. Entrails Ripped From A Virgin's Cunt


Alive alone now that they've gone dead but unburied
I've seen it unfold, terrible scenes of agony
Eyes in the darkness
Echoing their madness

The sights that have passed before them
Watching as though it has never happened
Now I only listen to what is not spoken

Murder, hatred
Anger, Savage
Killings I have caused
more than can be counted
orgies of sadism
And sexual perversion
Virgin
Tied to my mattress
Legs spread wide
Ruptured bowel, yanked
From her insides
Devirginized with my knife
Internally bleeding
Vagina, secreting
her blood-wet pussy
I am eating
on her guts I am feeding
Mutilated with a machete
I fucked her dead body
The first and last
Your life's only romance
My knife's jammed in your ass
As you die you orgasm

Pass on to the dead
Nerve trembling convulsions
No longer looking human

I never see them, but I know they're there
Locked in my subconcious
Obscene memories I thought I'd forgotten
Haunting unrealities
Tear at me
Hold her arms
Her mouth taped shut
Screams unheard
Out pour her guts

Layers of flesh peeling away
Languish in your own decay
descriptions of my killings
bone chilling

Terror, tear, her
Virgin cunt

Virgins are my victims
Their tight interiors I explore
Sharpened utensils of torture
Now inserted inside of her
Sex organs extracted for eating
On her liver I am gnawing

Forbidden lust for guts
Ripped from her cunt
Tears of blood cry down her thigh

I ram my fist inside her hole
From her crotch piss now flows
Rectum filled with shit
I fucked her emptied body
Until she became stiff


8. Post Mortal Ejaculation


Suffering my only need now is to hang
the rope does swing, hanging from the darkened ceiling
Strangling, dangling from my twisted spine
I knew I would enjoy death more than life
My lids close tight, but the light blinds my eyes
My body grows cold - my cock becomes erect

Watching over my dead shell, from beyond in my own hell
Caught between life and death, even though my body's dead
I still feel the touch of flesh
Given the choice to die or live dead
Purgatory my damnation
Climaxing at the resurrection
Adipocere spurts from my erection

Manifested in my rotted body
Unpure spirit, dead among mortals
I have risen from self-murder
Only to rot and kill
to break the necks of young women
their cunts my pus will fill
Acid burning through her crotch
I baptise her face with my rot
Then venom foams from her throat
On my discharge she will choke

Pulsation, my heart begins to beat
Heaving, goiters start to secrete
caustic odor, steaming gruel
wallow in my infected drool

Swollen pusing gashes
Start to reek

Puncture wounds in the back
hacked up limbs, bones now crack
Skin fillet from your face
Breasts gounged out
I fuck with your chest


9. Beyond The Cemetery


Nude and violated I raped the life from her body
Lying dead the insects bite her pale skin
My marks of torture
Left on my daughter
Body badly beaten
I remember
My ropes and chains
Bruised her arms and legs
I wiped her blood on my face
Her tender body I disgraced
Slow strangulation

Her neck twisted and broken
Abdominal lacerations
Blood pouring from
Abrasions

Control of the mind
Feelings left behind
Dreaming inner hate
I create an alternate state of the grave
Scared to death
Homicidal premonitions
Horror fills you
As your soul is ripped from you
Dreaming my dream of death
I cast the spell
Intertwine your mind with mine
Dreams become reality
Enhancing the imagination
Murder is my infatuation
Killing off generations

Families torn to pieces
But the one they love
Possessed by another
My pleasure is to murder

Entering your dreams
Through my spell they will bleed
Night after night
Reoccuring killings

Sleep

Someone wake me
From this nightmare
I've become my darkest fear

Awaken to the sight
Of your hacked up family
Their spirits are trapped
Beyond the cemetary

Bodies rotting, but I'm not sleeping
Scream you're not dreaming
Someone wake me
Form this nightmare
I've become my darkest fear
Came to life
In my mind
A world of darkness
Forever sleeping in this coffin
Eternally dreaming...

Forever sleeping in this coffin
Eternally dreaming...

Dreaming...
Dreaming...
Dreaming...
Dreaming...
Eternally...

Dreaming...

1. Meat Hook Sodomy


Butchery, my meat hooks sharpened to penetrate
Emasculate, gouging crotches I will eat
Hung upside down, holes punctured through half chewed gristle,
Debauchery with dead bodies, turning green

Upheaval of human entrails
Deterioration of grated genitals
Dangling from the hooks
Obscene feelings deep inside me

Dislocating, separating a blood-drenched body
Begin the anal grouting

Awaiting insertion
To rip out intestine
Bodily destruction
Vulgar molestation

Treachery, never ending soul ripping
Lifeless bodies rot, petrified
Clogging veins, pressure building
Scabbing clotted sores dehydrate
Condemned to life of obscurity
Dismal dimensions of my being
I explore my thoughts through murder
Devoting my life to mutilation

Screams of blood saturate
Grubs feed on dilapidated stumps
Darkness overshadowing...
The killing

Eyes now dilate
Bodies disintegrate
Razor sharp hooks implanted in your rectum
Splitting bodies, spilling guts on the ground
Sodomizing living beings with my utensils
Stabbing on your life stripped of all your skin
Disgusting to the world
Beauty to my eyes
The body lying naked
Discharging my infection

Invigorating while I kill, intoxicating
Invoking suffering on human beings
Grinding orifices my only therapy
Sculpting gore, muscle tissue
Reshaping mounds of flesh, deformation
Skulls of victims stacked like trophies
Bleeding from your arse, sudden blood ejection


2. Gutted


A tale of the deranged, this savage brutal being
A shocking way of life living on human offspring
Murder of the innocent,
His pale grey face, expressionless
Horrid dismemberment

One person's torture is another’s pleasure
Malformation, a diseased brain

Unsuspecting, slowly dying, as his knife invades the child,
Screams of pain, no one hears, blood splotches now appear,
Ecstasy through each cut, now the body twitches
The gutted little torso ready to be cooked 

Isolated in his own mind
The need to kill now possesses
His body self-mutilated

Between killings, ejaculation,
Cut off appendages of former victims,
Sexual violence satisfaction
Disembodied corpses, spewing gore
On his body, soaked with their fluids,
Various digestive parts and assorted meats

Plunging his fist down the throat,
Ripping out the guts, internal extraction

The entire body bleeding, the heart stops pumping
The child lying dead, just another gutted infant
To satisfy his hunger, temptations of the flesh
Voracious appetite
Killing to release pure souls to the heavens
Justification of his killing
Self-torture, stiffening pain
He sees the faces of the dead
Guts are strewn from the children
Splintered bones, poke through skin
Gratification through castration
Roasting parts for consumption


3. Living Dissection


Fingers missing from hands,
Ready to snap bones and necks,
Pieced together from dead tissue
Body parts crudely sewn,
Face is smashed to pulp
Drooling from an empty socket
Brain half dead, hungry for flesh
Many souls commanding my existence

My body alive,
I defy the life I've been given
I should have remained dead

Experimenting on dead tissue,
Convulsing bodies on the table
Reanimation of the dead,
Rusty scalpels cutting skin
Pieced together parts and parts
Transplanting human life
Rotten organs, rectal pus
Spitting up your gallbladder

Donation of bodily organs carved from broken bodies
Eyes melting, skin exploding
Every body bleeding
Meat inter-changed from the mutilated stiffs
Parts of the dead are never to rest
Lymphatic nodes Implode,
While the brain corrodes
Bodies sold to science, profiting from the dead
Creation of a being never known to man

Heart pumping pus through the body,
Sliced in sections, the putrid infection
Regaining life from beyond
To rip the flesh from your bones

Stripped of flesh, unsightly
Torn in two, slicing through you
Live organs needed to be reanimated

Pathologist sawing the skull of the donor,
Now he lies dead
Awaiting a new brain
Re-cycling the bodies, parts of the dead
Exposing their insides,
Slitting their necks

Finding a way, bringing life to the corpse,
Once dead on my table soon to walk again

Fingers missing from hands
Ready to snap bones and necks
Pieced together from dead tissue
Face is smashed to pulp,
Drooling from an empty socket
Brain half-dead, hungry for flesh
Many souls commanding my existence,
My body alive, I defy the life I've been given
I should have remain dead


4. Under The Rotted Flesh


Under the flesh: rot
My lust for decayed corpses
Dead bodies exhumed
Their coldness induces me

Endless defilement,
Reoccurring relapses,
Perverse with the dead,
Soon I will kill for myself
Impending suffering,
Spasms shooting through me
Nauseation
A cannibalistic necrophile

Violating the body,
Putrefied, moldering,
Gorging on the rotted flesh
Cutting off the body's head
Drinking from its severed neck
As I rip the corpse in half

Human shit for nourishment
Coprophagia, consuming feces of the dying,
As their bowels let loose
Defecation flows down my throat
Excremental investment
Reflections of things to come,
Mirrored in the dead one's eyes
My fantasy of murder
Incarnated

Open wounds gushing,
Blood on skin coagulated
Tortured of the wretched,
No one cares of their dead
Appalling odor wreaking,
Piles of rotted bodies

The bodies prepared for slaughter,
Wallowing in your own blood
Grinding off your fingers and toes
Feeding on your meat
I immerse my sharpened implement
Into a fresh bleeding gash
Her body used for my sick desires
The blood thirst I can't control
Many more must suffer

Disposal of the dead,
The corpse chopped to bits
Licking up the drivel
The gore enrages me

All I kill a new creation,
My work of art bodies torn apart
Liver quivering at my feet
Eyelids cut off to watch...
Your own dismemberment,
Cutting through arteries
Nerves exposed
Feel the power of pain


5. Covered With Sores


Bleed on me,
Digesting the clotted scabs
Blood thirsty
Ungodly
Passing on my curse, the spell pussing gores
Of those I infect, become my loyal servants
To ride me of my own rot
Whittling meat from the bones of the dead
Pulverizing pelvic regions with a sledge
The mutilated bodies I leave rotting
After I have fucked them with my knife

Becoming a product of my own nightmares
A bleeding sac of infection, years deceased

I hide my slobbering skin, covered by a victims flap
I love to watch the blood ooze down the bodies stump like sap,
A vulgar way of life, my hideous side now revealed
Remembering the future is the key to unlock my past
Leaking membrane, consuming bodies
Carving out the cunts, blood my lubrication

Spewing pus on rotted skin
I celebrate my cruelty,
Boils begin to form,
Dripping on my tongue

Swallowing throbbing glands,
The juice leaks from my lips,
My only thirst is pus
Eruption of cysts

Incurable disfigured bodies, I rape the dying
Horrific sights now manifest, penetrating inner organs
The ruptured organs leak the fluid that I seek
To break the incantation of my damnation

Split wide open,
Bloated organs burst
Nerves uprooted,
Reopening healed wounds
On my body
Sucking on the sores
Ingesting my own fluids
Self-parasitic puss indulgement


6. Vomit The Soul


Grotesque, crippled, carved up carcass
Evil controlling my mind,
The fear of dying expired of life,
To vomit the soul I am dead within my self

The end a beginning to a new life in hell
I am your path to ever-lasting pain
Mass extinction of the human population
Son of the devil the evil incarnation
Maniacal mass murderer mutilating mortals,
The child born unto evil,
Trapped within the statue of flesh
Vipers travel through bodily orifices, 

Blessed by the devil
Under inverted crosses,
Religious ways,
Lies controlling minds

I walk among mortal beings, but I have died
Excavating graves I search for decay
Packs of flesh driven zombies ready to feast
I suffer forever living only to dismember

Open season on humans,
Laughing I watch them die,
They bleed so easily
Their blood flows through my body,
I need to taste the flesh
Exposing pulsing arteries
Removing vital organs
Not stopping till you've died

Pus from your eyes carnal ways indulge in the gore
Slaughtered you lie in a pile of warm guts

Constricted corpuscles coagulating
Blood my drug a slave to its taste,
Reincarnated to human form,
Creating a race of immortal beings,
Rot away
Dead bodies, set a flame
Searing flesh, broken necks
You can't kill what's already dead

De-evolution, hunting for life
Cannibalism, immortality
Rip and slash, a society of mass murder
Bleeding slow

I take away your life,
And leave you lying cold,
Decapitated body
Searching for its head

Anticipate apocalypse,
Rising dead dismembering
Hacking limbs
Bleeding,
Cracking ribs
Torture us

Blessed by the devil,
Under inverted crosses
Religious ways,
Lies controlling minds

I walk among mortal beings, but I have died
Excavating graves
Desolate
Empty hollow corpse,
Desecrate
Forced to eat your flesh
Extracting purity
Violate
Twisted bodies rot away


7. Butchered At Birth


Birth is always painful
Decaying in the womb
Trapped within this body
A bleeding human tomb

Gutted bitch lies dead
Emptied of the child
Chewing on the cords
Its life line to this world
Afterbirth is flowing
The stench is overwhelming
My body, growing stronger
My pain turns to torture
Severing its bloodline
A butchered infant carcass

Meat from the unborn
The freshest kills
Chopped up children
Bathing in blood

Contorted and festering I rot in disgust
Re-generation of my body
Mother ripped apart
Smashing in her face
My knife cutting holes
Fucking her remains

Esophagus carved out
Crushing cartilage
Bile oozing from
Punctures in your liver

Ripping meat within
Chewing on intestine
Bladder spurting urine
Sight of defecation
Now grow infection
The child ripped to shreds
Drinking its excretions
Zombification

Ejaculation over mutilation
On the mother's body hacked into pieces

The sludges from my cock give her life once again
Sewing the remains of the child deep within her
Reborn through evil
My torture known throughout Hell
Heed to his calling
The demons await my next kill

Carnage is my fetish
Body cavities scraped of guts
Brains seeping from cracks
As my axe continues to hack


8. Rancid Amputation


Torsos hang from their own intestines
Raped of all bodily extensions,
Stumps wreathing in sludge like infection
Suffering through a Rancid amputation
A pulsating artery accompanied by some veins,
Slit with no restraint
Sacs of pus develop
My muscles tighten as I feel the rush

I look at your body starting to gush
I slice through the limb, a human dissection
Portions of half-eaten flesh in my mouth
Starting to chew your now bleeding stump
I will swallow your pus
Your own rectal slime I'll force you to drink
Vessels explode as needles injected

Uncontrollable, my brain tormented
Slit from head to toe, die through the torture
Disease engulfs you, internal rot
Fresh cut wounds, beginning to clot
Ripping through flesh is what I do best
Tear off an arm, amputated neck
Eyes removed, cranium smashed
Decomposing remains, severed in half

Dying slowly never to rest,
Nerves are quivering as I rip

Removal of life on the blade of my knife
Inserted in your spine, smashing through bone
Feel my hell, I feed on fright
Rape the limbless cadaver


9. Innards Decay


Rotting alive
Tearing my way through the meat
Driven to kill,
My brain twitching for guts
Devoted to evil
Severed arteries gush
Hungry for the blood
Life is to decay
Victims meet my blade, carving out organs
A world of pain and terror
Visions of the future
Premonition of the evil,
Forthcoming eve of darkness
The chosen one will come

Eyes torn out, bodies cut in half
Twisted corpses hang from broken necks
Demented madman, unholy rampage
Impaled cranium beginning to drain
Sodomize the carcass, chew the anal rot
Sewn within the body the dark becomes my light
Live inside the shell, feed upon infection
At one with the dead

I rip my way through easy prey,
Disfigured bodies decompose
Chewed limbs drip with pus,
Intestinal strangulation
Humans left ripped apart
Lap up the dripping goo
Wretched chunks of bleeding flesh
Internally you rot away

My need to kill induced by hate,
Betrayal of trusted ones
My mark left on this earth,
Victims of my slaughter
Souls of my dead, murdered by my hand
Blood on my face, innards decay
Snapping necks chewing flesh
Insatiable thirst for blood
Slicing throats viciously
Uncontrollable insanity
Tear out the beating heart
Engulf the quivering spleen,
Chew the meat
Death is my life
Life is to decay victims
Meet my blade carving out organs,
A world of pain and terror,
Visions of the future
Premonition of the evil
Forthcoming, eve of darkness
Eyes torn out bodies cut in half
Twisted corpses hang from broken necks,
Demented madman, unholy rampage
Impaled cranium beginning to drain.
